The issue occurs because cookies are domain-specific and rely on certain attributes like the domain, path, and security settings. When you access your application on a different device using your phone's IP address (e.g., http://192.168.x.x), the browser treats it as a different domain compared to localhost. This can cause cookies to not be set or sent due to misconfigured attributes.

Common Reasons and Solutions

1. Cookie SameSite Attribute

Problem: The SameSite attribute controls whether cookies are sent with cross-origin requests. By default, modern browsers set SameSite=Lax, which restricts cookies from being sent in cross-origin requests unless they are top-level navigations.

Solution: Set the SameSite attribute to None for cross-origin usage:

res.cookie('cookieName', 'cookieValue', {
  sameSite: 'None',
  secure: true, // Required for SameSite=None
  httpOnly: true,
});


2. Cookie Domain Attribute

Problem: If the cookie is set with a domain of localhost, it won't be sent when accessing the app via an IP address.

Solution: Avoid explicitly setting the domain attribute unless necessary. Let the browser handle it automatically:

res.cookie('cookieName', 'cookieValue', {
  httpOnly: true,
});


3. Secure Cookies

Problem: If you set the secure attribute on the cookie, it will only be sent over HTTPS connections. If you're using HTTP (not HTTPS), the cookie won't be set.

Solution: Use the secure attribute only in production or when using HTTPS:

const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
res.cookie('cookieName', 'cookieValue', {
  secure: isProduction,
  httpOnly: true,
});


4. IP Address vs. Hostname

Problem: Cookies set on localhost won't be sent when accessing the app via an IP address (192.168.x.x), as they are treated as different origins.

Solution: Access your app consistently using the same hostname or IP address.


5. CORS Configuration

Problem: If your client and server run on different origins (e.g., http://192.168.x.x vs. http://localhost), the browser enforces Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) rules. Cookies won't be sent unless CORS is properly configured.

Solution: Configure your server to allow credentials and set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header:

const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://192.168.x.x:3000', // Replace with your client IP and port
  credentials: true, // Allow cookies to be sent
}));

Also, ensure you include the credentials option on the client side:

fetch('http://192.168.x.x:5000/api', {
  method: 'GET',
  credentials: 'include', // Send cookies with the request
});


6. Firewall or Network Issues

Problem: If the devices are not properly connected to the same Wi-Fi network or if there is a firewall blocking communication, cookies may not work as expected.

Solution: Ensure both devices are on the same network and can communicate with each other.

Checklist for Debugging

1. Check the Set-Cookie Header: Use browser developer tools to inspect the response headers and verify that the cookie is being set correctly.


2. Verify the Domain and Path: Ensure the cookie is being set for the correct domain and path.


3. Use Consistent Access: Always access the app using the same hostname or IP address across devices.


4. Test CORS Settings: Ensure credentials: true is set both on the server and client.


5. Avoid Secure Cookies on HTTP: Only use secure: true when your app runs over HTTPS.
