Ah, I see! The issue lies with Socket.IO or WebSocket connections rather than a standard HTTP server. Let's address this.

Why the Socket Connection Fails

1. Localhost Binding: If your WebSocket server is bound to localhost or 127.0.0.1, it will only accept connections from the same device.


2. Cross-Origin Restrictions: If your frontend and backend are on different devices, the browser may block the WebSocket connection due to CORS issues.


3. Firewall or Network Restrictions: Your phone's firewall or the Wi-Fi network might block the WebSocket port.

Fixing the Issue with Socket.IO

Here's how you can configure your Socket.IO server and client to work across devices on the same Wi-Fi network:

Server Code

Ensure your Socket.IO server listens on 0.0.0.0 and allows cross-origin connections:

const http = require('http');
const socketIo = require('socket.io');

// Create an HTTP server
const server = http.createServer();

// Attach Socket.IO to the server
const io = socketIo(server, {
    cors: {
        origin: '*', // Allow all origins (adjust for production)
        methods: ['GET', 'POST']
    }
});

// Handle socket connections
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected:', socket.id);

    // Handle custom events
    socket.on('message', (data) => {
        console.log('Message received:', data);
    });

    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
        console.log('User disconnected:', socket.id);
    });
});

// Start the server
server.listen(3000, '0.0.0.0', () => {
    console.log('Socket.IO server running on port 3000');
});

Client Code

Ensure the client connects to the server using the server's IP address and port:

import { io } from "socket.io-client";

// Replace with your server's IP address and port
const socket = io('http://192.168.1.5:3000');

// Handle connection events
socket.on('connect', () => {
    console.log('Connected to server:', socket.id);
});

// Emit a custom event
socket.emit('message', 'Hello from client');

// Handle custom events
socket.on('response', (data) => {
    console.log('Response from server:', data);
});

Steps to Test

1. Find the Server's IP Address:

Check the IP address of the phone running the server (e.g., 192.168.1.5).



2. Use the Correct IP in the Client:

Replace http://localhost:3000 with http://<server-ip>:3000 in the client code.



3. Allow Cross-Origin Requests:

Ensure the server's CORS configuration allows the client's origin.



4. Ensure Both Devices Are on the Same Network:

Confirm that both phones are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.



5. Check for Firewalls:

Disable or configure any firewalls on the server device that might block the connection.

Debugging Tips

Server Logs: Check if the server logs a connection when the client attempts to connect.

Network Issues: Use tools like ping or a network scanner to confirm the devices can communicate.

Browser Console: Look for WebSocket errors in the browser console.
